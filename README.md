# Mini-Project

Following question was assigned to our team by Dr. Somaraju Suvvari (Assistant Professor-NITP) during third semester.

A university with 100,000 students and 5,000 courses needs to be able to generate two types of reports. 
The first report lists the registration for each class, and the second report should report lists, by student, the classes that each student is registered for. 
Come up with a new data structure for performing the above-mentioned tasks and implement them?
Discuss about the time complexities of each task in terms of number of students (m) and number of courses (n).
